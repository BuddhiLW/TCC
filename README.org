*** Significance of each file
- In =TCC-en.tex=, we can combile the english version of the
  Conclusion Thesis. which will generate a =TCC-en.pdf= file.
- =bashhlt.sty= and =pythonhlt.sty= are files to highlight (hlt) bash
  and python code inside the files.
- =bib.bib= is where every citation used in =TCC-en.tex= is stored in
  =json= sintax (BibTeX).

*** Significance of each folder (directory)
- =Imagens= contains all the image files I generated and used in both
  the presentation and the TCC file.
- =Julia= contains the code to reproduce the solution of the ODE
  presented in the Monograph.
- =Monograph-versions= has the many versions of Monograph that were
  produced while working towards the final version.
- =Notes= has org files at el. which are a collection of ideias I had
  to use in the monograph and presentation
- =Presentation= org-file with my presentation.
- =Schedule= the Gantt diagram I used to orient myself in scheduling
  the monograph steps.
* Some known possible bugs
** =\RequireXeTeX %Force XeTeX check=
To solve this, comment before this line.

This command is needed to force the compiler to use XeTeX. But, if
your machine automatically does that, then just comment before this
line.
