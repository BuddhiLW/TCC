#+begin_quote
"Thus, as everyone knows, the same algerbraic calculation can be used
to solve problems about pounds weight or pounds sterling, about
parabolas or motion under gravity. 


(...)This faculty of being able to give different meanings to the
words of prime concepts of a theory is indeed an important source of
enrichment of the mathematician's intuition.(...) aided often by
images from very varied sources, but founded above all on everyday
experience." cite:bourbaki2004theory

* FOSS            
*Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)*
** Four Essential Freedoms
- A program is free software if the program's users have the *four essential freedoms*: 
  * The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
  * The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
  * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
  * The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

    *NOTE*: these definitions entail some kind of social structure
* Community and Science
There is *similarity in structure* between Scientific and Open Source
community; social-structures; communication.

#+begin_quote
If words are not things, or maps are not the actual territory. Then,
obviously, the only possible link between the objective world and the
linguistic world is found in structure, and structure alone.

#+begin_quote
*4.11 Definition* Let A and B be partially ordered classes; a function f : A → B
is called an isomorphism if it is bijective and satisfies the following
condition:

For every two elements $x \in A$ and $y \in A$,
\begin{equation}
x \leq y \, \Leftrightarrow \, f(x) \leq f(y)
\end{equation}
